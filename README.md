# Plan:

- We are going to use OpenAI Assistants API to create a virtual laboratory
- Connect it with a 3D interface with Needle Engine
- Create an automatically synthesized team of agents to solve the problem
- Input problem, visualize the work of the virtual laboratory through the agents visualizing the chat bubbles and their work
- Have code interpreter agents that are running code, PI agents
