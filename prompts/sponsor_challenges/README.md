# Our virtual laboratory will use swarm intelligence to try to approach solving all of the hackathon challenges automatically

# The important details are formatted into text files for each challenge,

# Overview:
- Each challenge will be decomposed into steps that a swarm of agents can solve
- The agents will be synthesized based on the problem at hand
- The agents will be able to run code, python packages, and interact with the environment, and each other
- The user should be able to understand their reasoning
- Progress should be incremental and iterative
